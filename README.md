# Pythonisms

This is a repository that uses decorators and iterators on Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues. The intended functions for this repository are to:

- Decorator to turn a return string into swapcase also known as the Sarcastic Spongebob Case 
*As it turns out these are different, SwapCase is the opposite of title case where just the first letter is lowercase and the rest are capitalized while Spongebob Case are usually alternating capitalization. In this repository, decorators were created to do both.


Other things that can be done with decorators and iterators that I would like to look further into are:

- Decorators to verify that a Linked List, Stack or Queue has a root node 
- Iterator to For In  loop through a Linked List, Stack or Queue

The main.py file has the functions and display in-line tests for the decorators.
